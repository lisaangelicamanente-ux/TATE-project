### Word frequency distribution

The frequency analysis of words appearing in artwork titles reveals a pronounced
long-tail (Zipf-like) distribution, a pattern commonly observed in natural
language data. A small number of highly frequent terms accounts for a
large proportion of all titles, while the majority of words occur only rarely.

Highly frequent words tend to be generic and descriptive rather than expressive
or narrative. They often refer to artistic genres (e.g. *portrait*, *study*,
*landscape*), formal elements (e.g. *figure*, *head*), or compositional aspects.
This suggests that titles primarily function as classificatory labels, situating
artworks within established art-historical and curatorial categories.

In contrast, the long tail consists of a large number of low-frequency and highly
specific terms. While these words may carry richer semantic or contextual
significance, their rarity limits their usefulness for large-scale quantitative
generalisation, a well-known issue in computational analysis of cultural texts.

### Temporal patterns by decade

Grouping artworks by decade shows that the overall long-tail structure remains
stable across time. However, shifts can be observed in the relative prominence of
certain terms and semantic clusters.

Some descriptive words persist across decades, indicating continuity in
institutional cataloguing practices. Other terms show gradual changes in
frequency that loosely correspond to broader historical developments in art,
such as the increasing prominence of abstraction in the second half of the
twentieth century.

Rather than reflecting abrupt stylistic breaks, these patterns suggest slow
institutional adaptation in descriptive language, aligning with scholarship that
emphasises the inertia of classification systems.

### Titles as institutional language

The findings suggest that artwork titles in the Tate collection should not be
interpreted primarily as expressions of artistic intent. Instead, they appear to
function as products of institutional mediation, shaped by curatorial
conventions, archival needs, and cataloguing standards.

This interpretation resonates with art historical and museum studies research
that highlights the role of museums in framing and mediating meaning (Bennett
1995; Duncan 1995). In this context, titles operate less as expressive texts and
more as metadata designed to support organisation and retrieval.

### Methodological implications of the long tail

The observed long-tail distribution has important methodological implications.
While sentiment analysis or semantic classification techniques are often applied
to textual data, the sparse and descriptive nature of the vocabulary in this
dataset limits the reliability of such approaches.

Following critical digital humanities perspectives, this project treats
frequency-based analysis as a diagnostic tool that reveals structural properties
of the data and clarifies the limits of computational interpretation.

### Iteration and limits

An important outcome of this project is methodological rather than purely
substantive. Initial plans to explore affective or expressive dimensions of
titles were revised after encountering the descriptive and institutional nature
of the data.

This iterative process reflects best practices in computational humanities
research, where adapting research questions in response to data constraints is
central to responsible analysis (Rockwell & Sinclair 2016).

### Broader implications

More broadly, this project illustrates how large-scale cultural heritage datasets
encode institutional priorities and epistemologies. The language of artwork
titles reflects not only artistic practices but also historical conventions of
museum documentation.
